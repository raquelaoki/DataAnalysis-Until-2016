3) ITR: Item Theory Response analysis to measure the political knowledge of university students in Brazil

4) ML_FinalAssignment_2015: Machine Learning Course Project - 2015 - UFMG  
Group: Raquel Aoki and Fabrício Rodrigues Inácio  
Project: Classification model of supermarket products (Source: https://www.kaggle.com/c/otto-group-product-classification-challenge)  
Summary: The goal of this project was predict 9 labels from the dataset with 93 features. The F1 score was used to compare the approaches due the imbalance between classes and 2 dimensionality reductions methods were adopted: PCA and RBM. For the classification part we used SVM and we compare the results on the traning and testing set between SVM+93 original features with SVM+PCA features and SVM+RBM features. We also tested different dimensions in the features set from the PCA and RBM. The conclusion was that the SVM using the original features have the best results on the training set, but also suffers with overfitting, as we can see on the poor performance on the testing set. The SVM+63 features from the PCA has the best overall results.
